We seem to be having connection/lag issues.

I have ran the diagnostic script. but didn't see any value. 



I have manually added the 3 strategic plans to the strategic_plans folders





I have now reviewed the Medium confidence PDF downloads.  

3 were ok(FAc-596,644,and 651). 

2 were not proper strategic plans(FAC-681 and 790). I have updated the two manual_pdf_url's with the correct site.

lets call it a day. I would like a summary for the day.
