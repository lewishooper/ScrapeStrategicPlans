QUALITY INDICATORS (Overall Document)
=====================================
SPECIFICITY: Medium
SCOPE: Comprehensive
OVERALL_QUALITY_NOTES: Well-designed strategic plan with professional presentation and clear organizational structure. The document presents a unified vision ("Rooted in Wellness - Growing Together - Cultivating Health") and mission statement with five core values (Teamwork, Respect, Accountability, Compassion, Kindness). The four main strategic pillars are consistently formatted with clear "WE WILL DO THIS BY:" sections that provide specific goals and initiatives under each pillar. The cross-cutting DEI commitment is appropriately highlighted as foundational to all strategic work. Document demonstrates thoughtful strategic planning process with extensive community engagement (100+ staff touchpoints, 140 survey responses, 80+ patient/community touchpoints, 22 working sessions). However, the strategic priorities themselves lack descriptive text - each pillar title is followed immediately by specific goals and initiatives without conceptual explanation of what each priority area encompasses. The plan shows evidence of environmental scanning with key discoveries about population growth, aging demographics, staffing challenges, and technology needs. Strong emphasis on collaboration and partnership as evidenced by the "Together" theme throughout all pillars.
