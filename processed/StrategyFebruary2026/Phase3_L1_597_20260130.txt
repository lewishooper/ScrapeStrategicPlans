QUALITY INDICATORS (Overall Document)
=====================================
SPECIFICITY: Medium
SCOPE: Focused
OVERALL_QUALITY_NOTES: Clean, professionally designed strategic plan document with clear visual organization around four strategic priorities supported by organizational values (Teamwork, Inclusivity, Accessibility, Accountability). The plan uses a circular diagram format with the central vision statement surrounded by the four priority areas. Each priority has specific bullet-pointed goals and initiatives listed, but lacks descriptive text explaining what each priority area encompasses conceptually. The document demonstrates good strategic thinking with specific, actionable goals under each priority, but the high-level strategic directions go directly to implementation without conceptual framing. Strong visual presentation and clear structure, though minimal at the L1 descriptive level.
