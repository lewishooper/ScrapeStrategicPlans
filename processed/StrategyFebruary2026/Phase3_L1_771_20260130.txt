QUALITY INDICATORS (Overall Document)
=====================================
SPECIFICITY: Medium
SCOPE: Comprehensive
OVERALL_QUALITY_NOTES: Well-designed strategic plan with clear purpose statement "One team, here when you need us most" and professional presentation. The document is organized around five Strategic Commitments that cover the full range of hospital operations. Each commitment includes specific actions listed as bullet points, indicating good L2 content for future extraction. The plan demonstrates awareness of regional healthcare challenges including population growth, aging demographics, and capacity constraints. Strong emphasis on PRHC's role as a regional acute-care hospital serving 600,000 people. The document includes contextual information about community needs and healthcare system pressures. However, the strategic commitments themselves lack descriptive text explaining what each priority area encompasses - they jump directly from titles to action items. Values are clearly articulated (Act with courage, Embrace our community, Find common ground, Lead and learn, Recognize and appreciate). Overall a solid strategic framework with good implementation detail but minimal L1-level descriptive content.
