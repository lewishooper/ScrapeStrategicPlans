=====================================
QUALITY INDICATORS (Overall Document)
=====================================
SPECIFICITY: Medium
SCOPE: Comprehensive
OVERALL_QUALITY_NOTES: This document appears to be a strategic priorities overview or summary rather than a complete strategic plan, as it lacks timeframes, detailed context, and narrative descriptions of the priorities. The four strategic priorities are clearly organized and each contains three bullet-pointed sub-goals that would constitute Level 2 content. The mission, vision, and values are well-articulated. However, what appears as L1.X_TEXT in this extraction are actually the bullet-pointed goals under each priority rather than descriptive narrative text about what each priority means. The document jumps directly from priority titles to implementation goals without providing conceptual descriptions of the strategic directions. This represents an incomplete strategic planning document that would benefit from additional descriptive content at the priority level. The second page provides more specific tactical initiatives under each priority, demonstrating clear L2 content availability.
