OVERALL_QUALITY_NOTES: Professional bilingual strategic plan document with clear visual design and consistent formatting. The plan demonstrates solid strategic thinking with four well-defined priorities that cover the essential domains of hospital operations. Each priority includes a brief descriptive statement followed by detailed implementation strategies with specific icons and bullet points. The PACT values framework (Passion, Accountability, Compassion, Teamwork) is well-integrated throughout. Document includes demographic information about the communities served (68,500 in Stormont/Dundas/Glengarry, 89,000 in Prescott/Russell, 12,000 Mohawk Nation at Akwesasne, and 149,349 in Vaudreuil-Soulanges with 56.9% bilingual residents). The plan shows good balance between aspirational vision and practical implementation focus. Photography throughout shows diverse staff and patient interactions, reinforcing the community-centered approach. Strategic priorities are concise but could benefit from more detailed narrative descriptions at the L1 level.
