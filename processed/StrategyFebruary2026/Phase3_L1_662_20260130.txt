OVERALL_QUALITY_NOTES: Well-structured strategic plan with clear organization and professional presentation.

Each of the three strategic priorities includes detailed goals and objectives, success indicators, and proposed timelines spanning 2024-2028. The plan demonstrates thoughtful community engagement through interviews, focus groups, and a digital survey with 297 responses.
