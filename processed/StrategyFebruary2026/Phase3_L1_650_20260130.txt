=====================================
QUALITY INDICATORS (Overall Document)
=====================================
SPECIFICITY: Low
SCOPE: Focused
OVERALL_QUALITY_NOTES: Very brief, high-level strategic plan presented as a single-page overview with minimal detail. The four strategic goals are presented with short bullet-point descriptions rather than narrative text. The document emphasizes the hospital's Catholic healthcare mission and commitment to serving as a Centre of Excellence. The plan structure is clear but lacks the detailed strategic thinking, environmental analysis, and specific initiatives typically found in comprehensive strategic plans. The brevity suggests this may be a summary document rather than a full strategic plan. The focus on patient experience, employee culture, collaboration, and leadership demonstrates standard healthcare strategic domains but with very limited elaboration.
