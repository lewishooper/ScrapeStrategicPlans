=====================================
QUALITY INDICATORS (Overall Document)
=====================================
SPECIFICITY: Medium
SCOPE: Focused
OVERALL_QUALITY_NOTES: Professional strategic plan document with clear visual design and consistent formatting. The plan is organized around three strategic priorities with specific action items listed under each (marked as "We will:"). Each priority has a title but jumps directly to implementation goals without providing descriptive text about what the priority encompasses conceptually. The document includes well-developed Mission, Vision, and Values statements, plus a thoughtful Land Acknowledgement recognizing Indigenous territory. Strategic enablers are clearly identified (Strategic Partnerships, Digital and Data Infrastructure, Communications, Financial Resources). The plan shows evidence of comprehensive stakeholder engagement with over 1,000 people providing input. While the strategic framework is sound, the lack of descriptive text for the priorities themselves limits the conceptual depth at the L1 level, though substantial L2 content is available for future extraction.
