651,NA,1,Sustainability,"Building our future on a solid foundation

It is no secret that our health care system is facing significant financial pressures. Costs have risen while funding has not kept pace with the growing demand for care. In mental illness and addiction services, the need for expanded access and resources is urgent.

These complex realities highlight the need for The Royal to focus on strong financial and operational performance to ensure long-term stability, resilience and the ability to continue to meet the growing needs of our community.

The SPARQ strategic plan focuses on practical, incremental changes that strengthen corporate, financial and environmental sustainability over time.

Cultivate a positive work environment through transparency, collaboration and engagement

People are the heart and soul of The Royal. Supporting their well-being and fostering a positive work environment through transparency, collaboration and engagement is essential to our success and a measure of our commitment to one another.

Even before the COVID-19 pandemic overwhelmed the healthcare sector and exacerbated the mental illness and addiction crisis, the psychological and physical stress of our work was taking a toll on our people.

Workforce shortages in healthcare have made finding and keeping great people a challenge. And when we struggle to find enough qualified staff, it leads to increased workloads and burnout. It can be a vicious cycle.

To overcome these challenges, the SPARQ strategic plan will strengthen our commitment to being a great place to work, creating a culture guided by our values and focused on our purpose.

SPARQ builds on the work started by the Culture Club and our commitment to a whole-of-organization approach to improving employee well-being.

L1.3_TITLE: Access
L1.3_TEXT:
Break down barriers to mental illness and addiction care to provide high-quality and timely treatment for more people

Access to mental illness and addiction care has never been easy. For too long, stigma, lack of awareness and fear of disclosure have stood in the way of people seeking the help they need. While strides have been made to break down these barriers, significant challenges remain — and as awareness grows, so does the demand for care.

Today, people seeking support often face a fragmented, overburdened system and long waits that leave many turning to emergency departments across the region. These delays can lead to worsening conditions and increased complexity in the care required.

To truly improve access, the SPARQ strategic plan outlines how we will reimagine our role within the broader system, working more closely with primary care and community partners to create a more connected, responsive network of support.

L1.4_TITLE: Research
L1.4_TEXT:
Integrate what we learn from data into care and accelerate the translation of discoveries into practice

In any given year, one in four Canadians will experience a mental illness or addiction. Yet current approaches to treatment don't always work. In fact, available treatments work about half of the time. This stark reality underscores the urgent need for comprehensive research and intervention.

Yet, mental illness and addiction research is chronically underfunded, especially when directly related to care. That's why hospital-based research and innovation, like the work we do, are vital to closing the critical gap between discovery and patient care.

Our research provides real opportunities for improvement by unlocking the mysteries of the brain. And together with artificial intelligence and other advances in technology, these discoveries can be translated into more personalized and targeted evidence-based treatments that help more people access care that works for them.

L1.5_TITLE: Quality
L1.5_TEXT:
Raising the standard of quality, together

The healthcare system is facing complex challenges, including workforce shortages, rising costs, health equity disparities, patient safety concerns and data security risks. At The Royal, we're not immune to these pressures. These issues directly affect patient safety, experience and outcomes, and they also deeply impact the well-being of our staff.

In response, we are committed to integrating evidence-based care and innovation to improve experiences and outcomes at both the individual and system levels. We will foster a culture where patients, families and staff feel safe, respected and valued. Equity and inclusion will guide our care models and practices, helping us better meet the unique needs of the people and communities we serve.

By embracing continuous improvement and using data to evaluate our work and inform decisions, we will create a more connected, compassionate and high-quality system of care.

L1.3_TITLE: Growing with our Communities
L1.3_TEXT:
Meeting the needs of our fast-growing communities is a critical priority that requires bold action and ongoing investment.

However, rising emergency visits and complex care needs — driven by population growth, aging demographics and limited community-based options — are placing increasing strain on the system. Western York Region is growing at a rapid pace. In 2021, its population was 600,000. In 2031, the population will increase by 120,000. The seniors' population has also grown by 23 per cent. Mackenzie Health's Emergency Department is now the second busiest in Ontario. These capacity pressures are not sustainable. Expanding our specialized services is essential to delivering timely, high-quality, person-centred care close to home.

L1.4_TITLE: Integrated Care
L1.4_TEXT:
Integrated Care is integral to building healthier communities and ensuring people receive the right care, at the right time, in the right place. With rapid population growth, record-high emergency department volumes and limited hospital resources, expanding hospital-based services alone is not sustainable. To preserve our capacity for acute and specialized care, the broader health system must be strengthened through investments in care models that help keep people healthier in the community.

Looking ahead to 2025–2028, Mackenzie Health is working with partners to co-develop new, team-based primary care models supported by digital tools. These initiatives align with the Ontario Ministry of Health's Primary Care Action Plan and its $1.8 billion investment in expanding primary care teams.

The four strategic priorities are clearly organized and each contains three bullet-pointed sub-goals that would constitute Level 2 content. The mission, vision, and values are well-articulated. However, what appears as L1.X_TEXT in this extraction are actually the bullet-pointed goals under each priority rather than descriptive narrative text about what each priority means. The document jumps directly from priority titles to implementation goals without providing conceptual descriptions of the strategic directions. This represents an incomplete strategic planning document that would benefit from additional descriptive content at the priority level.

952,NA,1,Improve Population Health,"Traditional health care delivery has focused on providing the best possible care to patients who access the Lakeridge Health system. This approach often obscures the fact that health outcomes can vary significantly across and between groups of patients. Leading health care systems have recognized the need to understand and respond to the distinct needs of diverse populations to improve the overall health of the people they serve and reduce disparities in outcomes. Our Mental Health and Addictions and Oncology programs are already leaders in driving improvements at the population level and, building on this experience, Lakeridge Health will expand our population health focus across all our programs and services and our work with partners going forward.

A focus on population health will not eliminate disease, but it will ensure that each person living in the region will have the best opportunity for better health, whether they happen to be a child living with type 1 diabetes, a senior living independently at home, a middle-aged person newly diagnosed with cancer, a person experiencing addiction and homelessness, or a newcomer who is just learning to speak English. Population health approaches recognize that health is best understood not as the absence of disease, but as the ""capacity of people to adapt to, respond to, or control life's challenges and changes.""

It also means working with partners in health and social services across the region to ensure that people have a seamless experience as they transition across the health care continuum.

L1.3_TITLE: Create an Integrated System of Care
L1.3_TEXT:
Lakeridge Health has a responsibility to extend beyond our walls and think about our mandate as more than a health care provider. As one of the largest employers in the region, Lakeridge Health is crucial to local economic vitality and is uniquely positioned to become the connector between community members and a broad array of community health services. In addition to providing high quality acute health care services, Lakeridge Health will also work with partners across and beyond the area we serve to ensure that the regional population is able to access all continuum of integrated health and other services that promote health, wellness and quality of life.

Health system problems such as emergency department overcrowding, hallway health care, and people waiting for long-term care placement can only be solved by improving care, housing and social support options for people in the community. Success requires Lakeridge Health to reimagine our role within the regional health system – to be the connector for the community – and create partnerships and new service offerings we had previously not thought possible.

Every day a team of 6,200 people including physicians, nurses, allied health professionals and other team members alongside 1,500 amazing volunteers answer the call to provide essential care, treatment and support to people in the region. To become a truly high-performing health care system, Lakeridge Health will focus on supporting and empowering team members to improve the health and quality of life of the residents living throughout our vast geographic region.

SCOPE: Comprehensive
OVERALL_QUALITY_NOTES: This is a high-level strategic framework document presented as an infographic rather than a detailed strategic plan. The five strategic priorities are arranged in a circular visual format around the central vision ""Canada's leading community teaching health network."" Each priority has only a single sentence of descriptive text, making this a very concise, aspirational document. The mission (""Improving lives through exceptional care"") and values (""Compassionate, Inclusive, Courageous, Innovative"") are clearly stated. The document covers the expected strategic domains but provides minimal detail about implementation approaches, current state analysis, or specific goals. The visual presentation is professional and clear, but the content lacks the depth typically found in comprehensive strategic plans. This appears to be a summary or overview document rather than a full strategic planning document.

Strong performance is critical—not only for HPHA but for the entire health system.

Healthcare is a vital public service and one of Canada's largest sectors. It must be grounded in responsible business practices that protect financial sustainability and ensure timely, appropriate care.

Above all, healthcare must be accountable. At HPHA, we evaluate our work through this lens—ensuring services are grounded in engagement, innovation, evidence, and best practice, and are delivered in the most efficient and effective setting.
