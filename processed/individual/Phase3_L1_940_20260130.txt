=====================================
QUALITY INDICATORS (Overall Document)
=====================================
SPECIFICITY: Medium
SCOPE: Comprehensive
OVERALL_QUALITY_NOTES: Well-designed strategic plan framework document with professional presentation and clear visual organization. The document uses the CARE acronym effectively to organize four strategic priorities under the overarching shared purpose of "People First." Each priority includes both a title and a clear descriptive statement of what the priority encompasses. The framework is supported by five core values (Quality, Integrity, Respect, Teamwork, Compassion) and includes multiple photos of staff throughout the document showing the organization's commitment to its people-first approach. The document appears to be a framework or summary document rather than a detailed strategic plan, as it lacks specific timelines, detailed goals, or implementation tactics at the Level 1 presentation. However, the document structure suggests that more detailed Level 2 content (specific goals and initiatives) exists or would be developed under each priority area. The strategic planning process description indicates extensive community engagement and collaborative planning with over 200 individuals consulted.
