=====================================
QUALITY INDICATORS (Overall Document)
=====================================
SPECIFICITY: Medium
SCOPE: Focused
OVERALL_QUALITY_NOTES: This appears to be an incomplete strategic plan document or summary brochure rather than a full strategic plan. The document presents a clear organizational identity with well-defined Vision ("Exceptional People providing Exceptional Care"), Mission ("To provide the health care we would expect for our own families"), and enhanced Values (Compassion, Accountability, Respect, Excellence) with detailed descriptions. The three Strategic Priorities are clearly titled and each includes 2-3 "We will:" bullet points that represent specific goals/initiatives (L2 content), but there is no descriptive text explaining what each priority encompasses at the conceptual level. The document includes leadership messages, commitment to Truth and Reconciliation, and Patient and Family Advisory Council information, suggesting organizational maturity. However, the strategic content is minimal - essentially just priority titles with implementation goals beneath them. The document appears professionally designed but lacks the depth and detail typically expected in a comprehensive strategic plan. The DOCUMENT_ISSUES flag reflects that this appears to be a summary document rather than a complete strategic plan with full strategic content.
