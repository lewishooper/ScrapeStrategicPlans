QUALITY INDICATORS (Overall Document)
=====================================
SPECIFICITY: Medium
SCOPE: Comprehensive
OVERALL_QUALITY_NOTES: Well-designed strategic plan with clear visual presentation and professional formatting. The document presents mission, vision, and values prominently, followed by four strategic objectives represented by distinctive icons and color coding. Each objective has a brief descriptive title and bullet points outlining specific implementation areas. The plan demonstrates comprehensive coverage of key hospital domains (patients, staff, partnerships, growth) but provides minimal descriptive text at the L1 level - most content is structured as actionable bullet points that constitute L2 goals and initiatives. The visual design is particularly strong with consistent iconography and layout. The plan shows evidence of stakeholder input and systematic strategic thinking across all major operational areas.
