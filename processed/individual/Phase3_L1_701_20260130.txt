L1.1_TITLE: Patient Care Excellence
L1.1_TEXT:
At Mackenzie Health, Patient Care Excellence is the driving force behind everything we do, making it the focal point of our 2025-2028 Strategic Plan.

Looking ahead and building on the foundations of quality and safety, we're deepening our focus on compassionate, person-centred care. This includes reinforcing our commitment to empathy in every interaction and harnessing digital innovations and intelligent systems to elevate the care experience. These efforts will help empower Mackenzie Health to deliver exemplary, reliable and high-quality care every time — creating a world-class experience for every person we serve.

L1.2_TITLE: People are our Strength
L1.2_TEXT:
Our people at Mackenzie Health play a critical role in achieving patient care excellence and enabling us to deliver on our strategic priorities. The dedication of staff, physicians and volunteers to excellence, compassion and collaboration underpins our delivery of safe, high-quality, person-centred care.

Looking ahead and building on the foundation of recruitment, retention and high reliability, Mackenzie Health will modernize corporate services systems and workflows through a modern Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, advance learning and career pathways, invest in leadership development and continue to cultivate a strong sense of belonging, wellness and safety.

L1.3_TITLE: Growing with our Communities
L1.3_TEXT:
Meeting the needs of our fast-growing communities is a critical priority that requires bold action and ongoing investment.

However, rising emergency visits and complex care needs — driven by population growth, aging demographics and limited community-based options — are placing increasing strain on the system. Western York Region is growing at a rapid pace. In 2021, its population was 600,000. In 2031, the population will increase by 120,000. The seniors' population has also grown by 23 per cent. Mackenzie Health's Emergency Department is now the second busiest in Ontario. These capacity pressures are not sustainable. Expanding our specialized services is essential to delivering timely, high-quality, person-centred care close to home.

---

L1.4_TITLE: Integrated Care
L1.4_TEXT:
Integrated Care is integral to building healthier communities and ensuring people receive the right care, at the right time, in the right place. With rapid population growth, record-high emergency department volumes and limited hospital resources, expanding hospital-based services alone is not sustainable. To preserve our capacity for acute and specialized care, the broader health system must be strengthened through investments in care models that help keep people healthier in the community.

Looking ahead to 2025–2028, Mackenzie Health is working with partners to co-develop new, team-based primary care models supported by digital tools. These initiatives align with the Ontario Ministry of Health's Primary Care Action Plan and its $1.8 billion investment in expanding primary care teams.

L1.5_TITLE: Education and Research
L1.5_TEXT:
As part of our evolution, education and research are playing a greater role in advancing care quality, sparking innovation and strengthening the health system for the future.

Looking ahead to 2025-2028, an expanded teaching and research environment will enhance patient care, improve recruitment and retention, support community and system development, and strengthen primary and integrated care. Research will be central to improving care access, advancing patient outcomes and supporting learners in achieving their academic and professional goals.
