QUALITY INDICATORS (Overall Document)
=====================================
SPECIFICITY: Medium
SCOPE: Comprehensive
OVERALL_QUALITY_NOTES: Well-designed and professionally presented strategic plan with clear branding and visual identity. The document emphasizes community-inspired care with three symbolic icons (mountains, binoculars, hands) representing different aspects of their mission. The four Strategic Directions are clearly titled but jump directly to "We will:" action statements without providing descriptive text about what each direction encompasses. Strong emphasis on values-based approach with detailed articulation of Compassion, Accountability, Respect, and Excellence. The plan demonstrates good strategic thinking with stakeholder engagement noted (over 23 stakeholder groups consulted). Document is concise and accessible, though lacks the descriptive richness at the strategic direction level that would provide context for each priority area. The "We will:" statements under each direction provide clear L2 content with specific initiatives and goals.
