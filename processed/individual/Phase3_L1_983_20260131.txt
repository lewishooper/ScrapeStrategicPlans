=====================================

L1.1_TITLE: People
L1.1_TEXT:
We are guided by a simple but powerful principle: "Nothing for you, without you." This applies to everyone—patients, families, caregivers, staff, physicians, and volunteers. By centering people in our work, we build meaningful partnerships in both care delivery and service design.

Our highest priority is providing a safe and healthy workplace. In addition to delivering compassionate, high-quality care, HPHA is committed to environmental sustainability by reducing our operational impact.

To those who live and work in the communities we serve, we commit to being transparent, engaged, and bold advocates for the changes needed to support both a healthier population, and high-quality care—now and in the future.

L1.2_TITLE: Partnership
L1.2_TEXT:
Partnerships are central to transforming healthcare into a truly person-centered system.

HPHA recognizes that we are stronger together. Many of the most significant improvements occur when providers collaborate across traditional boundaries. This ensures care is delivered at the right time, in the right place, and by the right provider.

Whether in primary care, public health, long-term care, home and community care, hospital services, mental health, or emergency response—our collective impact is greatest when we work together, united in service to those we care for.

---

L1.3_TITLE: Performance
L1.3_TEXT:
Strong performance is critical—not only for HPHA but for the entire health system.

Healthcare is a vital public service and one of Canada's largest sectors. It must be grounded in responsible business practices that protect financial sustainability and ensure timely, appropriate care.

Above all, healthcare must be accountable. At HPHA, we evaluate our work through this lens—ensuring services are grounded in engagement, innovation, evidence, and best practice, and are delivered in the most efficient and effective setting.
