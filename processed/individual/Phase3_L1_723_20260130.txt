QUALITY INDICATORS (Overall Document)
=====================================
SPECIFICITY: Medium
SCOPE: Comprehensive
OVERALL_QUALITY_NOTES: Clean, professionally formatted strategic plan covering 2023-2026 with clear mission, vision, and values statements. The document is presented in both English and French versions. The five strategic directions are consistently formatted but contain only goal-level statements without descriptive text explaining what each strategic direction encompasses conceptually. Each direction jumps directly from title to specific goals (e.g., "Continue to build upon equity, diversity, inclusivity & belonging culture" under the first direction). The goals are specific and actionable, indicating strong L2 content, but the absence of L1 descriptive text limits the conceptual understanding of each strategic direction. The plan demonstrates comprehensive coverage of key healthcare strategic areas including equity, partnerships, safety, care integration, and organizational sustainability. Document includes organizational tagline "Caring for Today and Tomorrow" and serves the Matheson-Iroquois Falls-Cochrane communities.
