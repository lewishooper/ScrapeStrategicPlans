QUALITY INDICATORS (Overall Document)
=====================================
SPECIFICITY: Medium-High
SCOPE: Comprehensive
OVERALL_QUALITY_NOTES: Well-structured annual corporate plan that clearly connects to longer-term strategic outcomes (KHSC 2027). The document demonstrates strong alignment between current state descriptions and specific 2025-2026 objectives. Each strategic priority includes both aspirational outcomes and concrete implementation objectives. The plan shows sophisticated integration with regional health transformation initiatives (FLA OHT, Lumeo system). Professional presentation with clear visual design and consistent formatting. The fifth priority on equity and inclusion has notably less descriptive text compared to other priorities. Strong emphasis on partnership-based care delivery and academic health center positioning. The document effectively bridges high-level strategic direction with operational planning through specific annual objectives.
