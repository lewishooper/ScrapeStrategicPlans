QUALITY INDICATORS (Overall Document)
=====================================
SPECIFICITY: Medium
SCOPE: Comprehensive
OVERALL_QUALITY_NOTES: Professional strategic plan document with clear visual design and consistent formatting. The plan is organized around three main strategic priorities with supporting transformation catalysts. However, the document structure shows minimal descriptive text at the L1 level - most priorities jump directly into implementation goals and tactics. The strategic priorities are well-organized with detailed sub-goals and initiatives (L2 content), but lack substantial narrative description of what each priority area encompasses conceptually. The transformation catalysts section provides more descriptive content about organizational optimization, care redesign, and digital transformation approaches. The plan demonstrates strategic thinking with clear vision statement and tagline "Great people. Great care." The document includes good visual elements and professional presentation, though the L1 descriptive content is quite limited compared to the extensive L2 implementation details.
