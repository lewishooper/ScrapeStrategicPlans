QUALITY INDICATORS (Overall Document)
=====================================
SPECIFICITY: Medium-High
SCOPE: Focused
OVERALL_QUALITY_NOTES: Well-designed strategic research plan focused specifically on cardiovascular research excellence. The document presents a clear framework with four strategic goals and detailed Innovation Hubs covering major cardiovascular disease areas (Atherosclerosis and Cardiometabolic Diseases, Arrhythmias, Heart Failure, Brain and Heart, Valvular Heart Disease). The plan demonstrates sophisticated research strategy thinking with cross-cutting scientific priority themes and emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration. However, the document structure jumps directly from goal titles to detailed implementation elements without providing L1-level descriptive text for the strategic goals themselves. The Innovation Hubs section provides rich detail about specific research focus areas. Strong emphasis on regional partnerships, patient engagement, and translational research from bench to bedside. Professional presentation with clear visual elements and comprehensive coverage of research infrastructure needs.
