SPECIFICITY: Medium-High
SCOPE: Comprehensive
OVERALL_QUALITY_NOTES: Well-designed and professionally presented strategic plan with clear mission, vision, and values framework. The document demonstrates sophisticated strategic thinking with three core commitments that are consistently formatted and include both descriptive text and detailed objectives/goals beneath each. Strong emphasis on the mustard seed symbolism connecting to Catholic heritage and organizational growth metaphor. The plan shows evidence of extensive community engagement (over 1,000 individuals consulted) and includes diverse stakeholder input. Document structure clearly distinguishes between strategic priorities (L1) and implementation goals (L2). Notable features include focus on holistic care, research integration through Lawson Research Institute, and regional partnership emphasis. The plan balances aspirational language with specific measurable objectives at the L2 level.
