QUALITY INDICATORS (Overall Document)
=====================================
SPECIFICITY: Low
SCOPE: Comprehensive
OVERALL_QUALITY_NOTES: This is a professionally designed strategic plan document with strong visual branding and clear organizational structure. The plan demonstrates a rebranding effort from QHC to Quinte Health with new logo and visual identity. The document is well-organized around four aspirations (Care, Compassion, Connection, Our People) with detailed descriptive text for each aspiration area. However, the five strategic priorities themselves contain only titles with no descriptive text - they appear to go directly to implementation goals and initiatives. The aspirations provide rich narrative content about organizational values and direction, while the priorities function more as implementation categories. The plan shows evidence of extensive community engagement (2,200+ touchpoints) and includes four well-articulated values. The document represents a comprehensive strategic framework but with minimal L1-level descriptive content for the actual strategic priorities.
