QUALITY INDICATORS (Overall Document)
=====================================
SPECIFICITY: Medium
SCOPE: Comprehensive
OVERALL_QUALITY_NOTES: Well-designed executive summary of a five-year strategic plan with clear visual branding and professional presentation. The document demonstrates sophisticated strategic thinking with "Integrated Care" as the central organizing principle and clear vision/mission/values alignment. The three Strategic Priorities are consistently formatted with descriptive text explaining the conceptual foundation of each priority area. The plan includes comprehensive engagement metrics (847 staff/volunteer survey responses, 330 patient/community survey responses, 121 planning meetings) indicating thorough stakeholder input. Strong emphasis on the "honoured to care" culture and extraordinary patient experience as foundational elements. The document clearly distinguishes between strategic directions (L1) and implementation approaches (L2), with specific goals and initiatives present under each priority. Quality Patient Care and Service is positioned as a cross-cutting commitment rather than a separate strategic priority. The three Enablers and Accelerators (Investment and sustainability, Technology and state-of-the-art equipment, Data and analytics) provide additional strategic context.
