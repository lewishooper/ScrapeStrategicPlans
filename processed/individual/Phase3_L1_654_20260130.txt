=====================================

L1.1_TITLE: Build Upon Patient-Centred Care Through Quality and Safety
L1.1_TEXT:
In recognition of the important core of providing patient-centred care, and understanding the growing focus on safety and quality in all aspects within our operations, we will use this Pillar to focus our efforts. In addition, patients and their experiences are a wealth of knowledge to tap into. When we bring the voice of patients to the planning table, through engaging with Patient Advisors, we learn, improve and grow in our abilities to fulfil our caring Mission.

L1.2_TITLE: Enhance Care Coordination and Capacity
L1.2_TEXT:
We know how important it is to work towards a more seamless health journey for our patients, because the system itself is so complex and specialized. In addition, providing a comprehensive basket of services close-to-home is also important. This forms the basis for Pillar Number 2.

---

L1.3_TITLE: Embrace System Change, Grow Through Collaboration
L1.3_TEXT:
With the number of fundamentally transformative changes that are occurring within the health care system, we know that to continue to be successful as an organization, we must evolve and adapt to best take advantage of these changes. In addition, we know that the voice of small, rural, health care providers and patients must reach the ears of government, so as to influence policy and program changes. This Pillar strongly articulates this need.

---

L1.4_TITLE: Invest in Our People
L1.4_TEXT:
Healthcare is a people-oriented service; we work for patients, through the hands, minds, and hearts of our care-givers. All staff and clinicians have an important role to play in this. Every function within our Organization, whether it is direct hands-on care, or in various supportive roles, ultimately impacts upon our patients. Thus, we have selected Pillar Number 4 as key to our future efforts over the next 5 years.
