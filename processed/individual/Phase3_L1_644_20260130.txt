QUALITY INDICATORS (Overall Document)
=====================================
SPECIFICITY: Medium
SCOPE: Comprehensive
OVERALL_QUALITY_NOTES: Professional strategic plan document with clear visual design and comprehensive coverage of hospital operations. The plan is organized around three main strategic directions (Recovery, People, Integration) with multiple sub-priorities under each. However, the document structure jumps directly from priority titles to specific goals and initiatives without providing descriptive text explaining what each priority area encompasses. This results in all L1.X_TEXT fields being marked as "nf" despite the plan having substantial L2 content. The document demonstrates good strategic thinking with detailed goals, timelines, and measurable outcomes under each priority, but lacks the conceptual framing text that would typically describe what each strategic direction means. The mission, vision, and ICARE values are clearly articulated. Strong emphasis on post-pandemic recovery, staff wellbeing, and health system integration. The plan shows evidence of stakeholder engagement and environmental scanning but would benefit from more descriptive text explaining the strategic rationale for each priority area.
