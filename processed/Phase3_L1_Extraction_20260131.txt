QUALITY INDICATORS (Overall Document)
=====================================
SPECIFICITY: Medium
SCOPE: Comprehensive
OVERALL_QUALITY_NOTES: Professional strategic plan document with clear visual design and comprehensive coverage of hospital operations. The plan is organized around three main strategic directions (Recovery, People, Integration) with multiple sub-priorities under each. However, the document structure jumps directly from priority titles to specific goals and initiatives without providing descriptive text explaining what each priority area encompasses. This results in all L1.X_TEXT fields being marked as "nf" despite the plan having substantial L2 content. The document demonstrates good strategic thinking with detailed goals, timelines, and measurable outcomes under each priority, but lacks the conceptual framing text that would typically describe what each strategic direction means. The mission, vision, and ICARE values are clearly articulated. Strong emphasis on post-pandemic recovery, staff wellbeing, and health system integration. The plan shows evidence of stakeholder engagement and environmental scanning but would benefit from more descriptive text explaining the strategic rationale for each priority area.

DOCUMENT_ISSUES: None
L2_PRESENT: Yes
=====================================

L1.1_TITLE: Be a Great Place to Work
L1.1_TEXT:
"Empowering Exceptional People to Provide Exceptional Care"

Our people – DRHC staff, professional staff, physicians and volunteers- are our greatest asset. We need enough staff, with the right kinds of skills, who are highly engaged and energized to continue to offer our patients the type and scope of quality service DRHC wants to provide.

DRHC has always had strong HR strategies that have enabled us to be creative in attracting and retaining the best people. Now more than ever we need to be here for the staff and physicians we have invested in, ensuring they feel appreciated and are enabled to give their best every day. We know that if we are an exceptional place to work, DRHC will be successful at retaining our staff and at attracting new talent, even in this very competitive labour market.

---

L1.2_TITLE: Ensure Strong Foundations
L1.2_TEXT:
"Progressive Care for Changing Times"

We have learned a lot from the pandemic and know that stability is needed to get through difficult times. In order to continue to offer high quality services to our community, DRHC needs to ensure it is operating with strong foundations.

This means optimizing our financial resources, ensuring we are accessing funding effectively, and using the funds we have in the best way we can.

It also means ensuring strong service delivery foundations: knowing we are set up to deliver best quality services to our patients. We also need to ensure that our actions continue to be aligned with our core values, ensuring we demonstrate our respect and understanding for the unique needs of the populations that rely on us.

---

L1.3_TITLE: Lead New Solutions
L1.3_TEXT:
"Innovative Care through Collaboration"

It is clear that new solutions are needed to address the many pressures our community and our hospital is facing. Our ability to continue to serve our patients depends greatly on decisions being made outside our walls.

DRHC needs to take an active role in determining the future as the system changes and new ways of serving patients are being developed in our community. We need to ensure there is clarity about what DRHC will provide as it works together with others in new ways. We commit to being a catalyst for change.

We will dedicate resources and share our experience and expertise, providing leadership in pursuit of a system that provides better access to the types of care our communities needs.

OVERALL_QUALITY_NOTES: Very brief, high-level strategic plan presented as a single-page overview with minimal detail. The four strategic goals are presented with short bullet-point descriptions rather than narrative text. The document emphasizes the hospital's Catholic healthcare mission and commitment to serving as a Centre of Excellence. The plan structure is clear but lacks the detailed strategic thinking, environmental analysis, and specific initiatives typically found in comprehensive strategic plans. The brevity suggests this may be a summary document rather than a full strategic plan. The focus on patient experience, employee culture, collaboration, and leadership demonstrates standard healthcare strategic domains but with very limited elaboration.

DOCUMENT_ISSUES: None
L2_PRESENT: Yes
=====================================

L1.1_TITLE: Sustainability
L1.1_TEXT:
Building our future on a solid foundation

It is no secret that our health care system is facing significant financial pressures. Costs have risen while funding has not kept pace with the growing demand for care. In mental illness and addiction services, the need for expanded access and resources is urgent.

These complex realities highlight the need for The Royal to focus on strong financial and operational performance to ensure long-term stability, resilience and the ability to continue to meet the growing needs of our community.

The SPARQ strategic plan focuses on practical, incremental changes that strengthen corporate, financial and environmental sustainability over time.

---

L1.2_TITLE: People
L1.2_TEXT:
Cultivate a positive work environment through transparency, collaboration and engagement

People are the heart and soul of The Royal. Supporting their well-being and fostering a positive work environment through transparency, collaboration and engagement is essential to our success and a measure of our commitment to one another.

Even before the COVID-19 pandemic overwhelmed the healthcare sector and exacerbated the mental illness and addiction crisis, the psychological and physical stress of our work was taking a toll on our people.

Workforce shortages in healthcare have made finding and keeping great people a challenge. And when we struggle to find enough qualified staff, it leads to increased workloads and burnout. It can be a vicious cycle.

To overcome these challenges, the SPARQ strategic plan will strengthen our commitment to being a great place to work, creating a culture guided by our values and focused on our purpose.

SPARQ builds on the work started by the Culture Club and our commitment to a whole-of-organization approach to improving employee well-being.

---

L1.3_TITLE: Access
L1.3_TEXT:
Break down barriers to mental illness and addiction care to provide high-quality and timely treatment for more people

Access to mental illness and addiction care has never been easy. For too long, stigma, lack of awareness and fear of disclosure have stood in the way of people seeking the help they need. While strides have been made to break down these barriers, significant challenges remain — and as awareness grows, so does the demand for care.

Today, people seeking support often face a fragmented, overburdened system and long waits that leave many turning to emergency departments across the region. These delays can lead to worsening conditions and increased complexity in the care required.

To truly improve access, the SPARQ strategic plan outlines how we will reimagine our role within the broader system, working more closely with primary care and community partners to create a more connected, responsive network of support.

---

L1.4_TITLE: Research
L1.4_TEXT:
Integrate what we learn from data into care and accelerate the translation of discoveries into practice

In any given year, one in four Canadians will experience a mental illness or addiction. Yet current approaches to treatment don't always work. In fact, available treatments work about half of the time. This stark reality underscores the urgent need for comprehensive research and intervention.

Yet, mental illness and addiction research is chronically underfunded, especially when directly related to care. That's why hospital-based research and innovation, like the work we do, are vital to closing the critical gap between discovery and patient care.

Our research provides real opportunities for improvement by unlocking the mysteries of the brain. And together with artificial intelligence and other advances in technology, these discoveries can be translated into more personalized and targeted evidence-based treatments that help more people access care that works for them.

---

L1.5_TITLE: Quality
L1.5_TEXT:
Raising the standard of quality, together

The healthcare system is facing complex challenges, including workforce shortages, rising costs, health equity disparities, patient safety concerns and data security risks. At The Royal, we're not immune to these pressures. These issues directly affect patient safety, experience and outcomes, and they also deeply impact the well-being of our staff.

In response, we are committed to integrating evidence-based care and innovation to improve experiences and outcomes at both the individual and system levels. We will foster a culture where patients, families and staff feel safe, respected and valued. Equity and inclusion will guide our care models and practices, helping us better meet the unique needs of the people and communities we serve.

By embracing continuous improvement and using data to evaluate our work and inform decisions, we will create a more connected, compassionate and high-quality system of care.

With the number of fundamentally transformative changes that are occurring within the health care system, we know that to continue to be successful as an organization, we must evolve and adapt to best take advantage of these changes.

OVERALL_QUALITY_NOTES: Well-designed strategic plan with professional presentation and clear organizational structure. The document presents a unified vision ("Rooted in Wellness - Growing Together - Cultivating Health") and mission statement with five core values (Teamwork, Respect, Accountability, Compassion, Kindness). The four main strategic pillars are consistently formatted with clear "WE WILL DO THIS BY:" sections that provide specific goals and initiatives under each pillar. The cross-cutting DEI commitment is appropriately highlighted as foundational to all strategic work. The plan demonstrates thoughtful strategic development with evidence of extensive stakeholder engagement (100+ staff touchpoints, 140 survey responses, 80+ patient/community touchpoints, 22 working sessions). However, the strategic priorities jump directly from titles to implementation goals without providing descriptive text about what each priority area encompasses conceptually. The document shows strong attention to community health needs assessment and demographic analysis, noting significant population growth projections and aging demographics. The Alliance structure covering three hospitals (Groves Memorial Community Hospital, Palmerston and District Hospital, Louise Marshall Hospital) is clearly explained.

OVERALL_QUALITY_NOTES: This is a single-page strategic framework document rather than a comprehensive strategic plan. It presents the hospital's Vision ("Together, a healthier community for everyone"), Mission ("Exemplary and equitable care for and with our community"), and five core Values (Compassionate, Inclusive, Respectful, Collaborative, Inspired) with detailed behavioral descriptions for each value. The five Strategic Directions are presented as titles only with accompanying icons but no descriptive text, goals, or implementation details. The document appears to be a summary or overview piece rather than a full strategic planning document. The Values section is the most developed portion, providing specific behavioral examples for each value. The document is professionally designed with good visual presentation but lacks the depth and detail typically found in comprehensive strategic plans. The DOCUMENT_ISSUES flag reflects that this appears to be an incomplete strategic planning document missing the detailed strategic content typically expected.

SCOPE: Comprehensive
OVERALL_QUALITY_NOTES: Professional strategic renewal document with strong visual design and clear organizational structure. The document effectively communicates the health system's mission, vision, and values while presenting three strategic directions with supporting enablers. However, the document appears to be an overview or summary presentation rather than a complete strategic plan, lacking specific timelines, detailed implementation plans, and measurable objectives that would typically be found in a full strategic plan document. The content focuses heavily on high-level strategic positioning and organizational identity, with emphasis on the legacy of the Sisters of St. Joseph and the integrated nature of the health system across multiple member organizations. The strategic directions are clearly articulated but remain at a conceptual level. Document issues noted as "Incomplete" because this appears to be a strategic framework or summary rather than a comprehensive strategic plan with full implementation details.

DOCUMENT_ISSUES: None
L2_PRESENT: Yes
=====================================

L1.1_TITLE: Patient Care Excellence
L1.1_TEXT:
At Mackenzie Health, Patient Care Excellence is the driving force behind everything we do, making it the focal point of our 2025-2028 Strategic Plan.

Looking ahead and building on the foundations of quality and safety, we're deepening our focus on compassionate, person-centred care. This includes reinforcing our commitment to empathy in every interaction and harnessing digital innovations and intelligent systems to elevate the care experience. These efforts will help empower Mackenzie Health to deliver exemplary, reliable and high-quality care every time — creating a world-class experience for every person we serve.

---

L1.2_TITLE: People are our Strength
L1.2_TEXT:
Our people at Mackenzie Health play a critical role in achieving patient care excellence and enabling us to deliver on our strategic priorities. The dedication of staff, physicians and volunteers to excellence, compassion and collaboration underpins our delivery of safe, high-quality, person-centred care.

Looking ahead and building on the foundation of recruitment, retention and high reliability, Mackenzie Health will modernize corporate services systems and workflows through a modern Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, advance learning and career pathways, invest in leadership development and continue to cultivate a strong sense of belonging, wellness and safety.

---

L1.3_TITLE: Growing with our Communities
L1.3_TEXT:
Meeting the needs of our fast-growing communities is a critical priority that requires bold action and ongoing investment.

However, rising emergency visits and complex care needs — driven by population growth, aging demographics and limited community-based options — are placing increasing strain on the system. Western York Region is growing at a rapid pace. In 2021, its population was 600,000. In 2031, the population will increase by 120,000. The seniors' population has also grown by 23 per cent. Mackenzie Health's Emergency Department is now the second busiest in Ontario. These capacity pressures are not sustainable. Expanding our specialized services is essential to delivering timely, high-quality, person-centred care close to home.

---

L1.4_TITLE: Integrated Care
L1.4_TEXT:
Integrated Care is integral to building healthier communities and ensuring people receive the right care, at the right time, in the right place. With rapid population growth, record-high emergency department volumes and limited hospital resources, expanding hospital-based services alone is not sustainable. To preserve our capacity for acute and specialized care, the broader health system must be strengthened through investments in care models that help keep people healthier in the community.

Looking ahead to 2025–2028, Mackenzie Health is working with partners to co-develop new, team-based primary care models supported by digital tools. These initiatives align with the Ontario Ministry of Health's Primary Care Action Plan and its $1.8 billion investment in expanding primary care teams.

---

L1.5_TITLE: Education and Research
L1.5_TEXT:
As part of our evolution, education and research are playing a greater role in advancing care quality, sparking innovation and strengthening the health system for the future.

Looking ahead to 2025-2028, an expanded teaching and research environment will enhance patient care, improve recruitment and retention, support community and system development, and strengthen primary and integrated care. Research will be central to improving care access, advancing patient outcomes and supporting learners in achieving their academic and professional goals.

OVERALL_QUALITY_NOTES: This document appears to be a website or promotional material about KDH's strategic plan rather than the actual strategic plan document itself. The content shows the hospital's vision statement about being "a hospital that is much more than a place for treating illness" and mentions their Strategic Plan "Your Hospital, Your Community: Growing Together" covering 2022-2026 with five strategic directions and four key priorities each. However, the document only lists the five strategic direction titles without any descriptive text, goals, or implementation details. The plan was developed with over 800 stakeholders and mentions upcoming progress reports, but the actual strategic content is not present in this document. There are references to viewing the "Strategic Plan flip book" and "Strategic Plan At-A-Glance" but these materials are not included. The document also contains news items and a patient testimonial, suggesting this is more of a website homepage or overview rather than the comprehensive strategic plan itself.

Strategic enablers are clearly identified (Strategic Partnerships, Digital and Data Infrastructure, Communications, Financial Resources).

SPECIFICITY: Low
SCOPE: Limited
OVERALL_QUALITY_NOTES: This is a high-level strategic framework document rather than a detailed strategic plan. The document presents five strategic priorities with visual icons and brief taglines (e.g., "Working together to provide care that meets your needs and wishes" for Patients as Partners) but provides no descriptive text explaining what each priority means or encompasses. The document focuses primarily on presenting the hospital's mission, values, and basic service descriptions rather than strategic planning detail. The format is more of a strategic overview or summary document suitable for public communication rather than an operational strategic plan. The visual presentation is clean and professional with consistent branding, but lacks the depth typically expected in strategic planning documents. No goals, initiatives, or implementation details are provided under any of the strategic priorities.

L1.1_TITLE: People
L1.1_TEXT:
We are guided by a simple but powerful principle: "Nothing for you, without you." This applies to everyone—patients, families, caregivers, staff, physicians, and volunteers. By centering people in our work, we build meaningful partnerships in both care delivery and service design.

Our highest priority is providing a safe and healthy workplace. In addition to delivering compassionate, high-quality care, HPHA is committed to environmental sustainability by reducing our operational impact.

To those who live and work in the communities we serve, we commit to being transparent, engaged, and bold advocates for the changes needed to support both a healthier population, and high-quality care—now and in the future.

---

L1.2_TITLE: Partnership
L1.2_TEXT:
Partnerships are central to transforming healthcare into a truly person-centered system.

HPHA recognizes that we are stronger together. Many of the most significant improvements occur when providers collaborate across traditional boundaries. This ensures care is delivered at the right time, in the right place, and by the right provider.

Whether in primary care, public health, long-term care, home and community care, hospital services, mental health, or emergency response—our collective impact is greatest when we work together, united in service to those we care for.

---

L1.3_TITLE: Performance
L1.3_TEXT:
Strong performance is critical—not only for HPHA but for the entire health system.

Healthcare is a vital public service and one of Canada's largest sectors. It must be grounded in responsible business practices that protect financial sustainability and ensure timely, appropriate care.

Above all, healthcare must be accountable. At HPHA, we evaluate our work through this lens—ensuring services are grounded in engagement, innovation, evidence, and best practice, and are delivered in the most efficient and effective setting.

OVERALL_QUALITY_NOTES: This appears to be an incomplete strategic plan document or summary brochure rather than a full strategic plan. The document presents a clear organizational identity with well-defined Vision ("Exceptional People providing Exceptional Care"), Mission ("To provide the health care we would expect for our own families"), and enhanced Values (Compassion, Accountability, Respect, Excellence) with detailed descriptions. The three Strategic Priorities are clearly titled and each includes 2-3 "We will:" bullet points that represent specific goals/initiatives (L2 content), but there is no descriptive text explaining what each priority encompasses at the conceptual level. The document includes leadership messages, commitment to Truth and Reconciliation, and Patient and Family Advisory Council information, suggesting organizational maturity. However, the strategic content is minimal - essentially just priority titles with implementation goals beneath them. The document appears professionally designed but lacks the depth and detail typically expected in a comprehensive strategic plan. The DOCUMENT_ISSUES flag reflects that this appears to be a summary document rather than a complete strategic plan with full strategic content.

=====================================
SPECIFICITY: Medium
SCOPE: Comprehensive
OVERALL_QUALITY_NOTES: Professional strategic plan document with clear visual presentation and well-organized structure. The plan is presented as an infographic-style summary with five strategic priorities clearly identified in a matrix format. Each priority has a corresponding strategic objective (e.g., "Strive for fiscal sustainability" under Finances, "Value our team" under People). However, the document provides only the priority titles and brief strategic objectives without any descriptive narrative text explaining what each priority area encompasses. The plan includes the hospital's purpose statement about being a leader in the local health system committed to improving health and wellness of the culturally diverse community, along with clearly articulated values (People, Communication, Quality Care Close to Home, Accountability, Teamwork). The document appears to be a summary version of a larger strategic plan, focusing on high-level direction rather than detailed description of priority areas.

SPECIFICITY: Low
SCOPE: Limited
OVERALL_QUALITY_NOTES: This is a single-page summary document presenting Riverside Health Care's vision, mission, values, and four strategic pillars. The document appears to be a high-level overview or summary rather than a complete strategic plan. Each strategic pillar has only a brief one-line description with no detailed goals, initiatives, or implementation details. The document is professionally formatted with clear branding and visual design, but lacks the depth and detail typically found in comprehensive strategic plans. The absence of timelines, specific objectives, measurable targets, or detailed strategic content suggests this may be an executive summary or promotional piece rather than the full strategic planning document. The DOCUMENT_ISSUES flag of "Incomplete" reflects that this appears to be a summary document rather than a complete strategic plan with the expected level of strategic planning detail.

SCOPE: Comprehensive
OVERALL_QUALITY_NOTES: This document appears to be a strategic priorities overview or summary rather than a complete strategic plan, as it lacks timeframes, detailed context, and narrative descriptions of the priorities. The four strategic priorities are clearly organized and each contains three bullet-pointed sub-goals that would constitute Level 2 content. The mission, vision, and values are well-articulated. However, what appears as L1.X_TEXT in this extraction are actually the bullet-pointed goals under each priority rather than descriptive narrative text about what each priority means. The document jumps directly from priority titles to implementation goals without providing conceptual descriptions of the strategic directions. This represents an incomplete strategic planning document that would benefit from additional descriptive content at the priority level. The second page provides more specific tactical initiatives under each priority, demonstrating clear L2 content availability.

SCOPE: Comprehensive
OVERALL_QUALITY_NOTES: Professional strategic plan document with clear visual design and consistent formatting. The plan is organized around three main strategic priorities with supporting transformation catalysts. However, the document structure shows minimal descriptive text at the L1 level - most priorities jump directly into implementation goals and tactics. The strategic priorities are well-organized with detailed sub-goals and initiatives (L2 content), but lack substantial narrative description of what each priority area encompasses conceptually. The transformation catalysts section provides more descriptive content about organizational optimization, care redesign, and digital transformation approaches. The plan demonstrates strategic thinking with clear vision statement and tagline "Great people. Great care." The document includes good visual elements and professional presentation, though the L1 descriptive content is quite limited compared to the extensive L2 implementation details.

OVERALL_QUALITY_NOTES: This is a very high-level strategic framework document that presents four strategic directions as titles only, with no descriptive text explaining what each priority encompasses. The document jumps directly from strategic direction titles to implementation goals and initiatives. While professionally presented with clear branding and visual design, the strategic content is minimal and lacks the narrative depth typically found in comprehensive strategic plans. The mission statement "Together - be the model of excellence in rural healthcare" and core values (Compassion, Accountability, Integrity, Respect) are clearly articulated, but the strategic directions themselves lack conceptual explanation. The document appears to be more of a strategic framework or summary rather than a detailed strategic plan, though it does contain specific goals and initiatives under each direction that would be suitable for Level 2 extraction.

OVERALL_QUALITY_NOTES: Well-designed strategic plan framework document with professional presentation and clear visual organization. The document uses the CARE acronym effectively to organize four strategic priorities under the overarching shared purpose of "People First." Each priority includes both a title and a clear descriptive statement of what the priority encompasses. The framework is supported by five core values (Quality, Integrity, Respect, Teamwork, Compassion) and includes multiple photos of staff throughout the document showing the organization's commitment to its people-first approach. The document appears to be a framework or summary document rather than a detailed strategic plan, as it lacks specific timelines, detailed goals, or implementation tactics at the Level 1 presentation. However, the document structure suggests that more detailed Level 2 content (specific goals and initiatives) exists or would be developed under each priority area. The strategic planning process description indicates extensive community engagement and collaborative planning with over 200 individuals consulted.

SPECIFICITY: Low
SCOPE: Limited
OVERALL_QUALITY_NOTES: This appears to be an overview or summary document rather than a complete strategic plan. The document presents four strategic priorities with very brief descriptive text (single sentences) and includes some supporting goals under each priority, but lacks the depth and detail typically found in comprehensive strategic plans. The document is professionally designed with good visual presentation including quotes from leadership and family members, but provides minimal strategic content. The plan timeframe is unclear - titled "2021 and Beyond" but no specific end date is provided. Document issues flagged as "Incomplete" because this appears to be a high-level summary rather than the full strategic plan document, which would typically contain more detailed strategic analysis, environmental scanning, and comprehensive goal statements.

DOCUMENT_ISSUES: None
L2_PRESENT: Yes
=====================================

L1.1_TITLE: Improve Population Health
L1.1_TEXT:
Traditional health care delivery has focused on providing the best possible care to patients who access the Lakeridge Health system. This approach often obscures the fact that health outcomes can vary significantly across and between groups of patients. Leading health care systems have recognized the need to understand and respond to the distinct needs of diverse populations to improve the overall health of the people they serve and reduce disparities in outcomes. Our Mental Health and Addictions and Oncology programs are already leaders in driving improvements at the population level and, building on this experience, Lakeridge Health will expand our population health focus across all our programs and services and our work with partners going forward.

A focus on population health will not eliminate disease, but it will ensure that each person living in the region will have the best opportunity for better health, whether they happen to be a child living with type 1 diabetes, a senior living independently at home, a middle-aged person newly diagnosed with cancer, a person experiencing addiction and homelessness, or a newcomer who is just learning to speak English. Population health approaches recognize that health is best understood not as the absence of disease, but as the "capacity of people to adapt to, respond to, or control life's challenges and changes."

---

L1.2_TITLE: Commitment to Individual Health Care
L1.2_TEXT:
People expect accessible, high quality health care close to home. For Lakeridge Health, this means a relentless focus on improving clinical practices and meeting the highest standards within all our local hospitals, community services and specialized regional programs as well as a commitment to empower patients and their families to become true partners in care. It also means working with partners in health and social services across the region to ensure that people have a seamless experience as they transition across the health care continuum.

---

L1.3_TITLE: Create an Integrated System of Care
L1.3_TEXT:
Lakeridge Health has a responsibility to extend beyond our walls and think about our mandate as more than a health care provider. As one of the largest employers in the region, Lakeridge Health is crucial to local economic vitality and is uniquely positioned to become the connector between community members and a broad array of community health services. In addition to providing high quality acute health care services, Lakeridge Health will also work with partners across and beyond the area we serve to ensure that the regional population is able to access all continuum of integrated health and other services that promote health, wellness and quality of life.

Health system problems such as emergency department overcrowding, hallway health care, and people waiting for long-term care placement can only be solved by improving care, housing and social support options for people in the community. Success requires Lakeridge Health to reimagine our role within the regional health system – to be the connector for the community – and create partnerships and new service offerings we had previously not thought possible.

---

L1.4_TITLE: Be a Workplace of Choice
L1.4_TEXT:
Success depends on the strength of the team and our ability to recruit and retain the healthiest people. Lakeridge Health is focused on being an employer of choice in the Canadian health care sector and strives to be a place where the people want to start, build and finish their careers in health care. We will provide the tools for team to be productive, positive difference in the lives of people around them, recognizing that our people are under tremendous pressure, dealing literally with matters of life and death.

Every day a team of 6,200 people including physicians, nurses, allied health professionals and other team members alongside 1,500 amazing volunteers answer the call to provide essential care, treatment and support to people in the region. To become a truly high-performing health care system, Lakeridge Health will focus on supporting and empowering team members to improve the health and quality of life of the residents living throughout our vast geographic region.

The document is well-organized around four aspirations (Care, Compassion, Connection, Our People) with detailed descriptive text for each aspiration area. However, the five strategic priorities themselves contain only titles with no descriptive text - they appear to go directly to implementation goals and initiatives. The aspirations provide rich narrative content about organizational values and direction, while the priorities function more as implementation categories. The plan shows evidence of extensive community engagement (2,200+ touchpoints) and includes four well-articulated values. The document represents a comprehensive strategic framework but with minimal L1-level descriptive content for the actual strategic priorities.

SCOPE: Comprehensive
OVERALL_QUALITY_NOTES: Well-structured strategic plan document with clear Vision, Mission, and Values statements followed by four Strategic Directions (Enrich quality of care for patients, Ignite the power of our people, Nurture our social responsibility, Accelerate discovery). Each direction contains multiple strategic priorities with brief descriptive text. The document appears to be incomplete as it lacks specific goals, timelines, and implementation details that would typically follow the strategic priorities. The 16 strategic priorities are consistently formatted with concise one-paragraph descriptions. The plan covers comprehensive areas including patient care, workforce development, social responsibility, research, and innovation. Document shows good strategic thinking but limited detail on execution. The incomplete nature (missing end date and detailed implementation plans) suggests this may be an excerpt or summary version of a larger strategic planning document.

OVERALL_QUALITY_NOTES: Well-designed strategic research plan focused specifically on cardiovascular research excellence. The document presents a clear framework with four strategic goals and detailed Innovation Hubs covering major cardiovascular disease areas (Atherosclerosis and Cardiometabolic Diseases, Arrhythmias, Heart Failure, Brain and Heart, Valvular Heart Disease). The plan demonstrates sophisticated research strategy thinking with cross-cutting scientific priority themes and emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration. However, the document structure jumps directly from goal titles to detailed implementation elements without providing L1-level descriptive text for the strategic goals themselves. The Innovation Hubs section provides rich detail about specific research focus areas. Strong emphasis on regional partnerships, patient engagement, and translational research from bench to bedside. Professional presentation with clear visual elements and comprehensive coverage of research infrastructure needs.

L1.3_TEXT:
As the needs of Niagara Health's patients, community and team members change, we must transform how we work. We will become one truly regional system, functioning seamlessly across sites.

SCOPE: Comprehensive
OVERALL_QUALITY_NOTES: Well-designed strategic plan with professional presentation and clear organizational structure. The document presents a unified vision ("Rooted in Wellness - Growing Together - Cultivating Health") and mission statement with five core values (Teamwork, Respect, Accountability, Compassion, Kindness). The four main strategic pillars are consistently formatted with clear "WE WILL DO THIS BY:" sections that provide specific goals and initiatives under each pillar. The cross-cutting DEI commitment is appropriately highlighted as foundational to all strategic work. Document demonstrates thoughtful strategic planning process with extensive community engagement (100+ staff touchpoints, 140 survey responses, 80+ patient/community touchpoints, 22 working sessions). However, the strategic priorities themselves lack descriptive text - each pillar title is followed immediately by specific goals and initiatives without conceptual explanation of what each priority area encompasses. The plan shows evidence of environmental scanning with key discoveries about population growth, aging demographics, staffing challenges, and technology needs. Strong emphasis on collaboration and partnership as evidenced by the "Together" theme throughout all pillars.

OVERALL_QUALITY_NOTES: Professional strategic plan document with clear mission, vision, and values statements. The plan is organized around seven strategic pillars covering comprehensive operational areas. Each pillar contains multiple specific goals and initiatives, indicating good strategic depth at the L2 level. However, the document structure provides pillar titles without descriptive text explaining what each pillar encompasses - it moves directly from titles to bulleted goals and initiatives. The plan demonstrates cultural sensitivity with Indigenous focus, including Traditional Healing Medicine Foods and Support program integration. Strong emphasis on serving First Nations communities (85% of population served). The document includes leadership messages and values statements with cultural imagery. Well-formatted with consistent structure across all pillars, though lacking L1-level descriptive content for the strategic priorities themselves.

SPECIFICITY: Medium
SCOPE: Comprehensive
OVERALL_QUALITY_NOTES: Professional strategic plan document with clear visual design and comprehensive coverage of hospital operations. The plan is organized around three main strategic directions (Recovery, People, Integration) with multiple sub-priorities under each. However, the document structure jumps directly from strategic priority titles to specific goals and initiatives without providing descriptive text explaining what each priority encompasses conceptually. Each priority section contains detailed goals, key actions, and performance indicators, indicating strong L2 content availability. The plan demonstrates thoughtful strategic thinking with focus on post-pandemic recovery, people-centered approaches, and health system integration. Mission, vision, and values are clearly articulated with the ICARE framework (Integrity, Compassion, Accountability, Respect, Engagement). The document includes photos of staff and facilities, enhancing presentation quality. While strategically comprehensive, the lack of L1 descriptive text for priorities limits conceptual understanding of what each strategic direction means to the organization.

The plan presents four Strategic Directions in a clean, structured format with each direction supported by 2-3 specific bullet points that represent goals and initiatives. The document includes the hospital's mission, vision, and four core values (Dignity, Excellence, Service, Integrity) prominently displayed. While the strategic directions have clear titles, there is no descriptive text explaining what each direction means - the document moves directly from titles to specific action items/goals. The bullet points under each direction are clearly L2 content (specific initiatives like "Embrace our Mission by championing compassionate care," "Become the leading workplace by prioritizing effective retention strategies," etc.). The plan demonstrates good strategic thinking with comprehensive coverage of key hospital operational areas, though the format prioritizes conciseness over detailed strategic narrative. The visual presentation is excellent with consistent formatting and professional design elements.

SPECIFICITY: Low
SCOPE: Comprehensive
OVERALL_QUALITY_NOTES: Brief strategic plan document that presents five strategic priorities with mission, vision, and values framework but provides minimal descriptive content at the L1 level. The document jumps directly from priority titles to implementation-focused content without providing conceptual descriptions of what each priority encompasses. Shows evidence of extensive stakeholder engagement (600+ employees, physicians, volunteers surveyed; 43 patients/family members; 14 leadership interviews; 25 external partners). Document notes key contextual factors including NBRHC's role as one of four major acute care hospitals in northeastern Ontario with 458 beds, regional mental health service provider, major teaching center, and specialized mental health care facilities. The plan acknowledges provincial health care trends including COVID-19 impact, aging populations, patient engagement focus, prevention investments, local integration, emerging technologies, and health human resources challenges. Professional presentation with clear visual framework showing the five strategic priorities, but lacks the descriptive narrative text typically found in more detailed strategic plans.

QUALITY INDICATORS (Overall Document)
=====================================
SPECIFICITY: Low
SCOPE: Comprehensive
OVERALL_QUALITY_NOTES: This is a high-level strategic framework document presented as an infographic rather than a detailed strategic plan. The five strategic priorities are arranged in a circular visual format around the central vision "Canada's leading community teaching health network." Each priority has only a single sentence of descriptive text, making this a very concise, aspirational document. The mission ("Improving lives through exceptional care") and values ("Compassionate, Inclusive, Courageous, Innovative") are clearly stated. The document covers the expected strategic domains but provides minimal detail about implementation approaches, current state analysis, or specific goals. The visual presentation is professional and clear, but the content lacks the depth typically found in comprehensive strategic plans. This appears to be a summary or overview document rather than a full strategic planning document.

L1.1_TITLE: People
L1.1_TEXT:
We are guided by a simple but powerful principle: "Nothing for you, without you." This applies to everyone—patients, families, caregivers, staff, physicians, and volunteers. By centering people in our work, we build meaningful partnerships in both care delivery and service design.

Our highest priority is providing a safe and healthy workplace. In addition to delivering compassionate, high-quality care, HPHA is committed to environmental sustainability by reducing our operational impact.

To those who live and work in the communities we serve, we commit to being transparent, engaged, and bold advocates for the changes needed to support both a healthier population, and high-quality care—now and in the future.

---

L1.2_TITLE: Partnership
L1.2_TEXT:
Partnerships are central to transforming healthcare into a truly person-centered system.

HPHA recognizes that we are stronger together. Many of the most significant improvements occur when providers collaborate across traditional boundaries. This ensures care is delivered at the right time, in the right place, and by the right provider.

Whether in primary care, public health, long-term care, home and community care, hospital services, mental health, or emergency response—our collective impact is greatest when we work together, united in service to those we care for.

---

L1.3_TITLE: Performance
L1.3_TEXT:
Strong performance is critical—not only for HPHA but for the entire health system.

Healthcare is a vital public service and one of Canada's largest sectors. It must be grounded in responsible business practices that protect financial sustainability and ensure timely, appropriate care.

Above all, healthcare must be accountable. At HPHA, we evaluate our work through this lens—ensuring services are grounded in engagement, innovation, evidence, and best practice, and are delivered in the most efficient and effective setting.
