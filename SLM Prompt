I would like to evalute the usefullness of setting up an SLM to monitor Hospital data.
The purpose would be to monitor hospital data and objectives over time. There are 130 Hospitals, and in general 5 years of data
The components would be numerous numerical/quantifable data including detailed budget data, and externally benchmarked Quality data.
Also available would be executive level turnover, and the high level strategic objectives 

How might an SLM help me monitor the performance
