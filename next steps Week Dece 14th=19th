Next Steps & Issues to Address
🔧 Immediate: Manual Review Phase (Next Few Days)

Review downloaded PDFs for accuracy
Check medium-confidence downloads
Add manual URLs where automation failed
Validate strategy URLs are correct

🐛 Issue #1: Test Configuration System
Problem: Test mode configuration is corrupted/unreliable
Need:

Simple end-to-end testing mechanism
Process one hospital at a time for verification
Clean test/production separation

Proposed Solution:

Create dedicated test script with single-hospital mode
Input: FAC number → Output: Full diagnostic report
No reliance on CONFIG$test_mode flag

📄 Issue #2: HTML-Only Strategic Plans
Problem: ~20-25% of hospitals only have HTML strategic plans (no PDFs)
Need:

Separate capture process for HTML content
Storage mechanism in strategic_plans folder
Conversion or archival strategy (PDF? Screenshot? Text extraction?)

Considerations:

Manual process vs automated web scraping
Format standardization
Integration with existing folder structure

🔮 Issue #3: Phase 4 - Content Analysis
Scope: Analyze all strategic plans for patterns and insights
Goals:

Identify common objectives across hospitals
Compare strategic priorities by hospital type/size
Extract key themes and trends
Generate comparative reports

Complexity Factors:

PDF text extraction and parsing
Natural language processing
Handling varied document formats
Meaningful categorization and analysis

Preliminary Thoughts:

May need R packages: pdftools, tidytext, textmineR
Possibly consider Python for advanced NLP
Define analysis framework before coding


Files Ready for Review Session

IdentifyAndDownloadStrategicPDF.R - Main processing script
Hospital_strategy.yaml - Complete results (133 hospitals)
yaml_to_tibble.R - New debugging helper
Summary CSVs in Outputs folder

Documentation Status

README.md reflects Phase 1-2
CLAUDE_WORKING_PREFERENCES.md is current
Will need updates after code review/streamlining
